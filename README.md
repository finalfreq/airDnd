# Air Dnd

Air Dnd was a project for my rails week 2 course at Epicodus. The idea for the app was to create a replicate site for Air Bnb. In our case we decided to build a project based off people needing a place to play dungeons and dragons.

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. You can then register for an account as a owner or a renter. If you are a buyer you can view dwellings and make reservations. As an owner you can post your listings and set the price as well as edit reservations.
